# Parser-FBL-servants-of-memory

This project is here to help you parse the creatures in the pdf Servants of Memory.
This module isn't perfect and won't be, you'll still have to fix some mistakes with dice/damages values.
This parser don't creat talents, you'll have to copy them yourself. But when parsed, creatures get there full text in the note field.

This module doesn't provide any assets for the creatures, but if you still have assets for them,
you can add these files by using naming as follow :

- Creature name (as marked in the pdf)
  for portrait : "Creature name.png"
  for tokens : "Creature name Token.png"
  The parser will add them while parsing creatures informations.
